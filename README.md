# Face Emotion Recognition Project

## Overview

This project is designed to recognize emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of faces into different emotion categories such as happy, sad, disgust, and surprise.

## Features

- Emotion recognition from facial expressions
- Utilizes CNNs for image classification
- Supports multiple emotion categories
- Easy to use and integrate

## Libraries Used

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries mentioned above.
2. Prepare your dataset with images of facial expressions categorized by emotions (e.g., happy, sad, disgust, surprise).
3. Organize your dataset into training and testing directories.
4. Run the provided Python script to train the CNN model on your dataset.
5. Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to measure its performance.
6. Use the trained model to predict emotions from new facial expression images.
